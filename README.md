# minimalistic-weather
A minimalistic weather app in Java. Made for a class.

If downloading the file, make sure that the JavaSE in .classpath is the version on your computer (currently, it's 1.8).
##Todo:
+ Finish up the GUI ~ make it look nicer, while still being minimal
+ Add a KeyListener to the ZIP field
+ Change the US -> Metric button into a switch or radio buttons or something more intuitive
+ Refresh the application by default on starting up
+ Listener for 6-day
+ ZIP field is acting up for 1-day, and buttons are off-screen (see screenshots in designs folder)
+ the 6-day layout is screwed up because I am horrible at GUI. It just needs to be resized, really. Check in the SixDay class
+ Comments. Comments would be good. Not necessary, but good.
